Hello there, I’m Yashesh Dasari, a graduate research assistant at University of Waterloo (in collaboration with Thornhill Medical). 
My graduate studies complete in December 2022. My research work explored the application of deep learning algorithms to classify MRI images using novel attributes.

I am currently looking for full-time roles in the areas of software development and machine learning engineering. I have experience in building software packages from
design to deployment using Python libraries.
