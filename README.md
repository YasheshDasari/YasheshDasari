## 👨‍💻 About Me

I am a software engineer with 5+ years of experience designing, developing, and supporting high-reliability, data-intensive systems in regulated and production environments.

My work focuses on:

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and SOLID design principles  
- Production-grade backend systems and REST APIs  
- Distributed and modular architectures  
- CI/CD, containerization, and cloud-based deployments  
- Performance optimization and algorithm-driven systems  

I have experience working in compliance-driven environments (IEC 62304, ISO 13485, FDA, Health Canada), building scalable and maintainable software systems with strong testing discipline.

I am passionate about writing clean, testable, production-ready code.
